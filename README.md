### Explaining AstroBWT  

AstroBWT is not a product of the current cryptosphere approach. It has roots in Information Theory and the Compression Domains.  
1. AstroBWT is based on mathematical proofs and research, unlike many other CPU mining ALGOs.  
1. All current mining algorithms are static. To explain more simply, all current cryptocurrency mining algorithms follow data dependent branches, loops or conditions. Dero also built out a RandomX implementation in Golang that has been discarded for use but open sourced to the public [RandomX in Golang](https://git.dero.io/DERO_Foundation/RandomX).    
1. AstroBWT, as the name implies, has BWT at it's core. BWT has been in research for the last 3 decades and numerous optimization attempts of GPU/FPGA have taken place. For more information on that topic, please refer to literature in the Information Theory and Compression Domains. However, all known implementations to this date, could not deliver an improvement even twice that of CPUs.  
1. All major providers (such as INTEL, NVIDIA etc) have already provided optimized implementations of BWT. Since, BWT has been used quite often in the general information theory and compression domains, it has been a subject of intensive studies. https://software.intel.com/en-us/ipp-dev-reference-burrows-wheeler-transform  
1. In the coming months or years that AstroBWT is optimized or shown to have a significant performance boost on FPGAs, ASICs, or GPUs there would be a benefit for everyone. Such an advancement could even trigger the next revolution in Bioinformatics, Signal Processing, DNA Sequencing or other numerous domains where BWT is used. So, AstroBWT will not only serve as an ASIC/FPGA and GPU resisitant algorithm but it will also succeed in helping scientific research if it is optimized for these things.
